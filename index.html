            <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Hi, I'm Scott, a self-taught developer. I've always enjoyed everything computer related since I was young and my mum wanted to become an IT teacher, so I got to go to classes with her and learned along with her it grew my passion to an unfathomable length. I went on to college and earned my Diploma in IT and started learning how to code in my spare time. My journey into the world of programming started there and hasn't stopped since.</p>

          <div class="project"><h3>Cards made with love</h3><p>My most recent paid project making a portfolio website for a greeting card business using two separate plugins for the contact form and gallery to keep the price down on hosting by using plain HTML, CSS and javascript.</p><a href="#">View Website</a></div>

          <div class="project"><h3>WebJam</h3><p>Having one week to complete a website based upon the theme of nature, I decided to make a charity website for African elephants and the ivory trade which won me first place which couldn't of made me happier.</p><a href="#">View Website</a></div>

          <div class="project"><h3>Les Chair</h3><p>Wanting to learn more about ecommerce and affiliate marketing, I decided to create a website using Amazon associate product links making a simplistic yet modern website using freely usable images.</p><a href="#">View Website</a></div>

          <div class="project"><h3>Lightning Light</h3><p>Wanting to learn more about ecommerce and affiliate marketing, I decided to create a website using Amazon associate product links making a simplistic yet modern website using freely usable images.</p><a href="#">View Website</a></div>

          <div class="project"><h3>Daddy's boy</h3><p>I wanted to learn more PHP and decided to keep with the affiliate marketing aspect, so rather than make another Amazon associates store, I decided on an adult website through MindGeek using PHP as backend.</p><a href="#">View Website</a></div>

          <div class="project"><h3>Expenses App</h3><p>After learning the syntax for javascript I decided to jump right in and made this expenses app without following a tutorial and learned how to first hand change a website using vanilla Javascript.</p><a href="https://codepen.io/scottajames/pen/mddreXz" target="_blank">View Code</a></div>

          <div class="project"><h3>Book Reading Timer</h3><p>I was about to read a book and wondered if there was a mathematical equation for how long it would take, and noticed there wasn't a web app for it, so I decided to make it myself like a true coder.</p><a href="https://codepen.io/scottajames/pen/bGNqdZQ" target="_blank">View Code</a></div>

          <div class="project"><h3>Wanderift</h3><p>My first project through Upwork was to design an email lead page for Wanderift following their color scheme, being my first paid project after only a year of coding as a hobby.

          <div class="project"><h3>Website Blocker</h3><p>My first large python project wanting to learn everything I knew python was a good language to start learning and wanting to start programming with it right away I created a website blocker.</p><a href="#">View Code</a></div>

          <h1 style="color:white;">Current Projects</h1>
            <div class="project"><h3>Amazon Donation Page</h3><p>I noticed on a lot of websites you can donate to an individual person you aren't sure what the money is being put towards so I decided to start a project where you can decide what to donate towards on an Amazon list rather than outright buying the item on a wishlist instead.</p><a href="#">Coming Soon</a></div>

            <div class="project"><h3>Comic Book Theme Generator</h3><p>I've used a lot of generators since starting out and wanting to learn more about them I decided I wanted to create a comic book generator where you can input images into each window on a palette you've chosen and then being able to save it as one complete image.</p><a href="#">Coming Soon</a></div>
